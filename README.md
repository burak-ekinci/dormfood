# DF - DormFood

## Project Name

DormFood

## Project Team - Individual

My name is Burak. My software adventure comes from my family's history, my curiosity in technology and electricity triggered my interest in the software world. My web development journey started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and grew stronger with Node.js. I worked on a community manager project, then delved into learning React.js, marking the start of a new project. Later, I enhanced my skills by transitioning to Typescript in another project.The world of blockchain fascinated me and I worked intensively to expand my knowledge in this field. I have conducted in-depth research on various topics, including blockchain logic, transactions, transaction structures, standards such as ERC20/721/1155, contract structures, the operation of files such as photos on IPFS, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). I completed the Solidity course and reinforced my knowledge with various exercises. Then, I successfully completed a course consisting of 5 projects that aligned with my goal of becoming a blockchain developer. While I was continuing to improve myself on networks such as Polygon Blockchain beyond Ethereum to gain new experiences, I did not want to miss the ICP internship opportunity and started working and here is my first Rust project.
